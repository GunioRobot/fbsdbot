TODO:

* Make bot FiSH ( http://fish.sekure.us ) -Compatible so users can use bot securely.
* Plugins should have an easy way to check if the user has special privileges.
* Add !seen functionality
* Make the bot host a DRb-object that will store users' now playing info       
  in the user database, and distribute a script that updates the database.

DONE:

* !man should use local man pages for performance boost
* Add !ports (freebsd-doc and ports indexed)
