REQUESTS:

* From Squat: Output longer than three lines should be sent as a private message

TODO:

* Refactor Action/Event stuff. Can probably remove the Action class now when we have control over the Event class and can add Event#reply() directly.
* Move to a more typical ruby project layout, get rid of require/File.dirname(__FILE__) chaos.
* Make bot FiSH ( http://fish.sekure.us ) -Compatible so users can use bot securely.
* Plugins should have an easy way to check if the user has special privileges.

MAYBE:

* Make the bot host a DRb-object that will store users' now playing info       
  in the user database, and distribute a script that updates the database.

DONE:

* !man should use local man pages for performance boost
* Add !ports (freebsd-doc and ports indexed)
* Add !seen functionality
