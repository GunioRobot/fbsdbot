  - The ragel parser in Ruby is slow compared to C. On a simple test, Ruby parser calls approximately 90x more ruby function calls.
 	To compile and run with C-extension, use:

		"rake parser:compile"
		NOTE: If you have Ragel installed, you can use: parser:generate:c (or parser:all for both Ruby and C parser)
